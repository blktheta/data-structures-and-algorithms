# Data Structures and Algorithms
A study on data structures and algorithms, inlcluding their implementation.

## Resources
The following examples are based on the book *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures sing Python* by Brad Miller and David Ranum, available to read online for free at https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/index.html. 

## Code Requirements
In order to provide with a great learning experience each example follow these specific rules:
* Implemented with as little code as possible.
* Include a before and after version if applicable.
* Well structured and documented.
* Written exclusively in Python 3.10.
